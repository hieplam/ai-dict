# E2E P1 Coverage Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** implement task-by-task; the orchestrator dispatches each task to a
> subagent (`hunter` for code fixes) and adjudicates between tasks. Steps use checkbox
> (`- [x]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** raise e2e case coverage from 77.3% (99/128) to ≥ 80% by repairing the red master
suite and landing the six staged P1 specs (→ 105/128 = 82.0%), with every wall held.

**Architecture:** no product code changes are expected — this is test-layer work in
`packages/extension-chrome/e2e/` plus the inventory doc. The six specs are already written on
branch `feature/E2eP1Cases` (stacked on the docs branch); the work is repair → verify → land.
Design rationale: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-e2e-coverage-goal-design.md`.

**Tech Stack:** Playwright (bundled Chromium + unpacked MV3 extension), Bun, TypeScript.

## Global Constraints

- Implementer: dispatch each repair/fix task to the `hunter` subagent — the orchestrator never
  writes the fix itself (owner ruling 2026-07-16).
- **Zero-flaky wall:** nothing merges while any full-suite run in the 3× read is red.
- **No-weakening wall:** never fix a red test by deleting/skipping it or loosening its
  assertions; 0 disabled functional tests, assertion count ≥ 279. A genuinely-wrong assertion
  may only change with an evidence note in the PR body.
- **Integrity wall:** `docs/testing/e2e-case-inventory.md` rows flip to `[covered]` only when
  the named spec passes in the 3× read; the denominator never shrinks.
- Every commit message starts with the branch tag (e.g. `[E2eP1Cases]`), imperative mood, no
  Co-Authored-By trailer. `bun run lint` + `bun run format:check` green before every commit.
- PRs merge with a **regular merge, never squash**.

### Task 1: Adjudicate the baseline read and repair the master suite

The 3× baseline read (build + `bun run e2e:chrome` ×3 on master) found run 1 red: 15 failed /
95 passed, clustered on the onboarding / no-key / settings-form surface. The suite must read
3× green before any new test lands.

**Files:**

- Read: the 3-run log (regenerate if absent: `bun run build:chrome && for i in 1 2 3; do bun run e2e:chrome; done 2>&1 | tee /tmp/e2e-3x.log`)
- Modify: whatever the diagnosis names — expected in `packages/extension-chrome/e2e/*.spec.ts`
  (stale selectors/copy) or, if the product regressed, the onboarding/no-key surface in
  `packages/app/src/ui/`.

**Steps:**

- [x] **Extract the failure set of each run** and compare:
      `grep -E "✘" /tmp/e2e-3x.log | sed 's/.*✘ *//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn` - Same tests fail in all 3 runs → **deterministic breakage**: the tests or the surface
      changed; diagnose per cluster below. - Failure sets differ across runs → **flakiness**: diagnose the unstable tests
      individually (timing, ordering, contention).
- [x] **Dispatch one hunter per failure cluster** (the onboarding/no-key cluster is one unit —
      12 of the 15 share a surface; `bottom-sheet-overflow`, `cache-history`,
      `error-reporting` are separate). Each hunter brief: reproduce the failure headed
      (`HEADED=1 bunx playwright test <spec> --project=chromium` from
      `packages/extension-chrome/`), read the failure screenshot under `test-results/`,
      determine whether the TEST is stale or the PRODUCT is broken, and hand back the
      diagnosis BEFORE fixing. Product regressions come back to the orchestrator for a
      routing decision (fix vs revert vs owner escalation) — they are not silently patched.
- [x] **Apply the adjudicated fixes** (hunter implements; no skips, no assertion loosening).
- [x] **Verify: full suite green 3× consecutively** — `for i in 1 2 3; do bun run e2e:chrome || break; done`
      Expected: 3 × exit 0, stable pass count.
- [x] **Commit** on a `fix/E2eBaselineRepair` branch:
      `git commit -m "[E2eBaselineRepair] fix: <diagnosis summary>"`, PR with a "Testing
      performed" section quoting the 3× green results, regular-merge after review.

**Task 1 outcome (2026-07-17): no code change — the suite was never broken.** All 15 failures
were build-environment artifacts: 11 tests need the no-key state but `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the
build shell baked `__GEMINI_KEY_FROM_ENV__=true` (onboarding skipped by design);
`error-reporting.spec.ts:93`'s GA4-flush assertion needs GA4 vars baked in; 3 were one-off
contention flakes. **Binding env law for every e2e build:**
`GEMINI_API_KEY='' GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID='G-E2ETEST' GA4_API_SECRET='e2e-test-secret' bun run build:chrome`.
Clean 3× read: 110/110 green each run (~5.2m/run). No commit was needed on
`fix/E2eBaselineRepair`. Follow-up candidate (not in this PR): bake the env law into the
`e2e:chrome` script.

### Task 2: Verify and land the staged P1 specs

**Files (already written on `feature/E2eP1Cases`, stacked on the docs branch):**

- `packages/extension-chrome/e2e/sanitize-hostile-output.spec.ts` — S4 proof: no execution
  (`window.__pwned` undefined), no `script`/`img` in the card, `javascript:` href stripped,
  `https:` link + `**bold**` survive.
- `packages/extension-chrome/e2e/lookup-timeout.spec.ts` — never-fulfilling route → network
  error card within 30s (client aborts at 20s); route hit exactly once.
- `packages/extension-chrome/e2e/provider-errors.spec.ts` — OpenAI 401, Gemini unconfigured →
  "OpenAI rejected the API key."; `gemini.count === 0`.
- `packages/extension-chrome/e2e/provider-fallback.spec.ts` (+2 tests) — exhaustion → primary
  error, both hit once; no-fallback-key → clean error, other providers at 0 calls.
- `packages/extension-chrome/e2e/lookup-pending-dismiss.spec.ts` — dismiss mid-flight (3s
  `delayMs` mock) → sheet count stays 0 after the late response.
- `packages/extension-chrome/e2e/helpers.ts` — `delayMs?: number` added to `MockGeminiOpts`.
- `docs/testing/e2e-case-inventory.md` — 6 rows flipped to `[covered]` (staged, uncommitted).

**Steps:**

- [x] **Rebase the branch onto master** (after Task 1 and the docs PR merge):
      `git -C .claude/worktrees/e2e-p1-cases rebase origin/master`
- [x] **Build and run only the new specs 3×** (they must meet the wall they are gated by):
      `bun run build:chrome && cd packages/extension-chrome && for i in 1 2 3; do bunx playwright test sanitize-hostile-output lookup-timeout provider-errors provider-fallback lookup-pending-dismiss || break; done`
      Expected: 3 × all green (9 tests per run: 5 new + 4 pre-existing fallback/picker tests).
- [x] **Red specs go to a hunter** with the failure output + the spec's assertion contract
      (above); the contract is the requirement — fix the test's mechanics or hand back a
      product finding, never weaken the assertion.
- [x] **Replay the metric** from the worktree:
      `grep -c '| \[covered\]' docs/testing/e2e-case-inventory.md` → expected **105**;
      gaps → **23**; 105/128 = **82.0% ≥ 80% target**.
- [x] **Commit**: `[E2eP1Cases] test: Add six P1 e2e cases (S4 sanitize, timeout, provider errors, fallback edges, pending dismiss)`

### Task 3: Wall read — full suite + no-weakening

- [ ] **Full suite 3× on the branch**: `for i in 1 2 3; do bun run e2e:chrome || break; done`
      Expected: 3 × exit 0 (now ~115 functional tests per run).
- [ ] **No-weakening check**:
      `grep -rE "test\.(skip|fixme)\(" packages/extension-chrome/e2e/*.spec.ts | grep -v "PLAYWRIGHT_RUN" | wc -l` → **0**;
      `grep -hoE "expect\(" packages/extension-chrome/e2e/*.spec.ts | wc -l` → **≥ 279** (expect ~300+ after the batch).
- [ ] **Gates**: `bun run lint && bun run format:check` → both green.

### Task 4: PR and merge

- [ ] **Open the PR**: title `[E2eP1Cases] Close six P1 e2e coverage gaps (77.3% → 82.0%)`;
      body = 1–3 sentence description + "Testing performed" section (3× new-spec runs, 3×
      full-suite runs with counts, lint/format gates) — no screenshots (owner evidence
      ruling 2026-07-16).
- [ ] **Merge with a regular merge** (`gh pr merge --merge`) after CI green.
- [ ] **Verify shipped**: PR state merged, merge commit has 2 parents, local master synced,
      worktree removed. Flip nothing else — the inventory rows landed in the same PR.

## Self-review

- Spec coverage: frame/walls (Global Constraints), baseline repair (Task 1), the six P1 cases
  (Task 2), wall reads (Task 3), delivery (Task 4). The spec's deferred items (P1 #7, OpenAI
  429/500, P2 probes) are deliberately absent.
- No placeholders: every step names its exact command and expected output; Task 1's unknown
  (the failure cause) is structured as diagnose-then-adjudicate rather than a guessed fix.
- Type consistency: n/a (no new product interfaces; the one helper change is `delayMs?: number`).
